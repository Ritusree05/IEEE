# Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool

---

## 📜 Overview
The **Caesar Cipher Encryption Tool** is a user-friendly application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text files using the Caesar cipher algorithm. With an intuitive GUI, users can upload a text file, provide a key, and instantly generate the encrypted output. This project serves as a foundation for exploring various cipher algorithms and encryption techniques.

## ✨ Features
- **🖥️ GUI Interface**: Simplifies the encryption process with an easy-to-use graphical interface.
- **📂 File Upload**: Supports text file input for encryption.
- **🔑 Custom Key Input**: Users can specify the shift key for the Caesar cipher.
- **📝 Encryption Output**: Displays and saves the encrypted text efficiently.
- **🔄 Extensible Design**: Ready to integrate more cipher algorithms in future updates.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Node 

### ⚙️ Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/Ritusree05/IEEE.git
   ```
2. Run the HTML file
   ```

### 🖱️ Usage
1. Launch the application.
2. Use the GUI to upload a text file.
3. Enter the shift key for encryption.
4. Click on radio button "Encrypt" then click on "process file" then "download processed file" to download the encrypted file.
5. Click on radio button "Decrypt" then click on "process file" then "download processed file" to download the decrypted file
